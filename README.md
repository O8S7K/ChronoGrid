# ChronoGrid

**ChronoGrid** is a 3D interactive cube composed of dynamically changing letters. Letters animate like mechanical counters — rapidly shifting characters that gradually slow down and settle on a final letter, creating a dynamic and rhythmic visual countdown effect.

This project merges digital aesthetics with mechanical nostalgia, creating an endless loop of symbolic transformation.

## 🧠 Artistic Inspiration

> This project is conceptually inspired by the work *Między* by Polish concrete poet and artist **Stanisław Dróżdż**.  
> In his 1977/2004 installation, Dróżdż explored the spatial and semantic dimension of language, focusing not on what is written, but on what lies **between** — _między_.  
> Similarly, **ChronoGrid** seeks to create a dynamic visual space where letters appear, shift, and float — forming not static words, but symbolic movement and tension in space and time.
